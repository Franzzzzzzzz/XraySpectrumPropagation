## Using SpekPy

Physics engine:
 - kpq: not much difference from the default "casim" engine at 180kV, for energies > 25kV
 


- All distances for objects are in mm. All distances for Xrays are in cm. (ie. spectrum calculation etc.). So when doing the absorption there need to be a conversion of distances. Density needs to be in g.cm^3 (ie. g/mL)
- Xray direction is z, vertical is y. 
 
## Todo (would be nice to have)
- arbitrary location and orientation for the tube
- multiple tubes
- arbitrary box orientation (easy to implement)
- arbitrary cylinder orientation (probably necessary for multitube anyway√†
